## Usage

![social-api](./public/images/social-api.png)

Start the application by running the `npm start` script. Once the server is running, you can leverage an HTTP request tool like Postman or Insomnia to test all of the API endpoints. All of the responses should return in JSON format and the POST and PUT requests must also be formatted in JSON.

## Contributing

There is an internal server error with a couple of the API routes for the Thoughts model. I'd love any input into what would be causing these issues.
